## Software Requirements
### Vision

What is the vision of this product?
<p>Our vision is to allow users to research cost of living indexes for potential areas in the world. Our use cases include young professionals, retirees, and people looking for the best price point in the suburbs can look up housing, gas, and supplies for different areas.</p>

What pain point does this project solve?
<p>This app will put price points into a side by side comparison for any user for free! </p>

Why should we care about your product?
<p> Because prices right? But also because it is more convenient and organized data that will help you understand metrics for when you are moving. Moving is one of the most stressful events in a person's life and we want to make sure it is less stressful. </p>

### Scope (In/Out)
IN - What will your product do
Describe the individual features that your product will do.
High overview of each. Only need to list 4-5:

- allow users to log in and log out
- allow users to research gas prices
- allow users to view cost-of-living dataset
- allow users to save city data and comparisons
- allow users to update and delete saved data

OUT - What will your product not do.

- will not work comprehensively examine all cost-of-living data
- user cannot write new city data
- will not be a published app

These should be features that you will make very clear from the beginning that you will not do during development. These should be limited and very few. Pick your battles wisely. This should only be 1 or 2 things. Example: My website will never turn into an IOS or Android app.

### Functional Requirements
List the functionality of your product. This will consist of tasks such as the following:

An admin can create and delete user accounts
A user can update their profile information
A user can search all of the products in the inventory
Data Flow
Describe the flow of data in your application. Write out what happens from the time the user begins using the app to the time the user is done with the app. Think about the “Happy Path” of the application. Describe through visuals and text what requests are made, and what data is processed, in addition to any other details about how the user moves through the site.

Non-Functional Requirements (301 & 401 only)
Non-functional requirements are requirements that are not directly related to the functionality of the application but still important to the app.

Examples include:

Security
Usability
Testability
etc….
Pick 2 non-functional requirements and describe their functionality in your application.

If you are stuck on what non-functional requirements are, do a quick online search and do some research. Write a minimum of 3-5 sentences to describe how the non-functional requirements fits into your app.

You MUST describe what the non-functional requirement is and how it will be implemented. Simply saying “Our project will be testable for testibility” is NOT acceptable. Tell us how, why, and what.
