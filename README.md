Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?
<br>We will be sure that everyone understands what we are doing and that we are using the driving/steering collaboration model via Code Fellows.
<br>We want to be sure that we switch up roles.
<br> We discussed having a backend and frontend specialist.
<br> We would like to each own a piece of the project as well.
